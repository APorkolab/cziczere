# üå± Cziczere: The AI-Powered Digital Memory Garden

Cziczere is a generative art and digital well-being application that transforms user memories into a unique, ever-evolving digital garden. Using advanced AI, each memory is planted as a "seed," which blossoms into a procedurally generated visual element, creating a beautiful and personal sanctuary of positive moments.

This project is not a journal; it's an interactive art piece powered by your own reflections.

## Core Concept & Vision

In a fast-paced digital world, Cziczere offers a space for quiet reflection. The core philosophy is to leverage technology not for productivity, but for mindfulness. By focusing on positive memories and gratitude, users cultivate a personal garden that serves as a visual representation of their joy and peace. The application uses a serverless architecture on Google Cloud to provide a scalable, cost-effective, and intelligent experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **AI-Enhanced Memory Input**: A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes user's memories to identify key themes, sentiments, and generate a creative prompt for image generation.
    
-   **Generative Visuals**: Each memory is rendered by Google's Imagen model into a unique visual element, which is then stored in Google Cloud Storage.
    
-   **Secure Authentication**: User authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication, ensuring that each user's garden is private and secure.

-   **Dynamic Garden Atmosphere**: The garden's ambient environment (background color and weather effects like rain/snow) now changes based on the overall mood of recent memories.
    
-   **Interactive Exploration**: Users can navigate their 3D garden, and click on memories to see the associated text. The garden layout is a beautiful and organic spiral.
    
-   **The Gardener's Assistant**: An AI-powered conversational agent that helps users find patterns in their thoughts and offers gentle prompts for reflection. This includes a "Weekly Summary" feature that provides a poetic overview of the user's recent memories.
-   **AR/VR Mode**: Place your memories in your own room and view them in augmented reality.
-   **Comprehensive Backend Unit Tests**: The backend functions are now covered by a suite of unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure reliability and correctness.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

 - Node.js (v18 or later) & npm
 - Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
 - Java JDK (v17 or later) & Maven
 - Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)
 - Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`

**Important:** After cloning the repository, run `npm install` in the `frontend` directory to install all required dependencies, including THREE.js for 3D rendering and AR functionality.

### Setup and Installation

    Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/aporkolab/cziczere.git
    cd cziczere

Google Cloud & Firebase Setup

 - Create a new project on the Google Cloud Console.
 - Create a new Firebase project and link it to your Google Cloud
   project.
   
   
 - Enable the following APIs in your GCP project: Vertex AI API, Cloud
   Functions API, Cloud Build API.
   
 - Crucially, set up a billing alert in the GCP console to avoid
   unexpected charges. A $5 alert is recommended to start.

Backend Setup (Cloud Functions)

    cd functions

   Authenticate with Google Cloud:

    gcloud auth application-default login

Create a .env.local file for local environment variables. See .env.example for the required variables:

        GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
        GCP_REGION="your-gcp-region" # e.g., us-central1

        Install Java dependencies:

        mvn install

Frontend Setup (Angular)

    cd ../frontend # from the root directory
    npm install

    Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Firebase web configuration in src/environments/environment.ts.

### Running the Application Locally

For local development, we will use the Firebase Local Emulator Suite.

Start the Backend Emulators
From the project's root directory, start the emulators for Functions and Firestore:

    firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore

This will start a local server for your Cloud Functions and a local Firestore database.

Start the Frontend Development Server
In a separate terminal, from the frontend directory:

    ng serve

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically connect to your local emulators.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

To deploy the application to your live Firebase project:

Build the Angular Application

    cd frontend
    ng build --configuration production

Deploy to Firebase
From the project's root directory, deploy the hosting, functions, and Firestore rules:

    firebase deploy --only hosting,functions,firestore

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new features or improvements, please follow these steps:

- Fork the Project
- Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
- Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
- Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
- Open a Pull Request

## üöÄ Future Work

-   **True AI-Generated Ambient Music**: The current implementation uses placeholder sounds. A future enhancement would be to integrate a true text-to-music AI to generate unique soundscapes for each mood.
-   **Therapeutic Tool**: With the involvement of psychologists, the application could be further developed into a scientifically supported mental health tool.
